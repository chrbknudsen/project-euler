A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

First a function that tests i a number is palindromic. Vectorized!

{r}
is_palindromic <- function(x){
  y <- as.character(x)
  y <- strsplit(y, "")
  y <- lapply(y, rev)
  y <- lapply(y, paste, collapse = "")
  y == x
}

{r}
t <- expand.grid(100:999, 100:999)
t <- t[,"Var1"] * t[,"Var2"]
answer <- max(t[is_palindromic(t)])
