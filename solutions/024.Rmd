A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For the objects 0, 1 and 2, "012" is one permutation. And "201" is 
another.

If we make all permutations of the digits 0 to 9, and order them in alphabetical order. What permutation is number one 
million?

We can get all permutations of the digits using `permutations()` from `gtools`. Convert to a tibble, arrange, and then
slice out the answer:
```{r eval  =FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gtools)
answer <- permutations(10, 10, 0:9) |> 
    as_tibble() |> 
    arrange(V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, V9, V10) |> 
    slice(1000000) |> 
    transmute(answer = paste0(V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, V9, V10))
```
