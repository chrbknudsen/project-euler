Studying the math, we learn that every hexagonal number is also triangular.

Therefore we only need to identify the next hexagonal number that is also pentagonal.

I have a helperfunction for that:

```{r}
source("helpers.R")
is_pentagonal
```

Generate hexanogals, and continue until one is pentagonal. We can start at 144.

I also have a helper function for generating hexagonals:

```{r}
hexagonal
```

```{r}
found <- FALSE
n <- 144
while(!found){
  if(is_pentagonal(hexagonal(n))){
    answer <- hexagonal(n)
    found <- TRUE
  }else{
    n <- n + 1
  }
}

```
