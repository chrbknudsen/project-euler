The Fibonacci sequence consists of elements $F_n$ defined by 

$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-1}$ Where $F_1 = 1$ and $F_2 = 1$.

What is the lowest n that results in $F_n$ containing 1000 digits?

Those are large numbers - so we use `fibnum()` from the `gmp` package. We wrap that in a function that returns
the number of digits;
```{r}
library(gmp)

fib_n_dig <- function(n){
    nchar(as.character(fibnum(n)))
}


```

And then we calculate the number of digits in $F_n$ for increasing n until the number of digits is 1000:
```{r}
n_d <- 0
n <- 0
while(n_d != 1000){
        n <- n + 1
    n_d <- fib_n_dig(n)

}
answer <- n
```
