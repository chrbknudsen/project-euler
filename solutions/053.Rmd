How many:
$$\binom{n}{r}$$

for $1 \le n \le 100$ are greater than 1.000.000.

r have to be smaller than (or equal to) n.

For at given combination of n,r, we get the number of combinations by:

```{r}
choose(23,10)
```

Generate all combinations of n,r, filter, mutate with the `choose` function,
filter and count:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

answer <- 1:100 %>% 
  expand_grid(Var1 = ., Var2 = .) %>% 
  transmute(n=Var1, r=Var2) %>% 
  filter(n>r) %>% 
  filter(choose(n,r)>1000000) %>% 
  count()
```
