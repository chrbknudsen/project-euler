An n-digit number is pandigital if it contains all digits from 1 to n 
exactly once.

I can't be bothered to write my own permutation function, the `RcppAlgos`
package can do it. I'll also need `tidyverse` and `numbers`: 
```{r}
library(RcppAlgos)
library(tidyverse)
library(numbers)
```

First, generate all pandigital numbers for n = 4 to 9.
```{r}

possible <- list()
for(i in 4:9){
possible[[i]] <- permuteGeneral(1:i) |> 
    apply(1, paste0, collapse = "")}
```

Unlist and convert to numeric:
```{r}
possible <- possible |> 
    unlist() |> 
    as.numeric()
```

 Remove all even numbers. And numbers divisible by 5:

```{r}
possible <- possible[possible%%2 != 0]
possible <- possible[possible%%5 != 0]
```

And then subset only the primes - and find the largest:
```{r}
answer <- possible[isPrime(possible)] |> max()
```
