How many sundays fell on the first of the month in the period 1 january 1901 
to 31 december 2000?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Construct vector with all dates from january first 1901 to december 31st 2000.

Filter to only get the first of every month. And to get sundays (running this
on a danish computer, so "søndag").

Get number of rows:
```{r}
answer <- as_date(as_date("1901-01-01"):as_date("2000-12-31")) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  filter(day(value) == 1,
         weekdays(value) == "søndag") %>% 
  nrow()
  
```
