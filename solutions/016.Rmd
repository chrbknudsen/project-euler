```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

$$2^{15} = 32768$$

The sum of the digits for 32768 is:

```{r}
3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8
```

What is the sum of the digits of the number $2^{1000}$?

That is a rather large number, larger than R is able to handle on its own.

We load the `gmp` package that can handle very large numbers:

```{r}
library(gmp)
```


```{r}
large_number <- as.bigz(2)^as.bigz(1000)
```

convert it to a character

```{r}
large_character <- as.character(large_number)
```
Split it in individual characters:

```{r}
large_character_vector <- strsplit(large_character, "")
```

That is a list, so we subset the first (and only) element, coerce it to 
numeric, and sum all the numbers:
```{r}
answer <- sum(as.numeric(large_character_vector[[1]]))
```
