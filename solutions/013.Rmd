```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

What are the first 10 digits of the sum of 100 numbers, each with 50 digits.
Trivial in Python, requires a library in R.

Strictly speaking we do not need to actually add all the numbers, it is enough
to add the first 11 digits of each number.



```{r eval  = FALSE}
library(gmp)
load("../data/013.RData")
the_sum <- sum(as.bigz(data))
n_digits <- ceiling(log10(the_sum))
the_sum %/% 10^(n_digits-10)
```
